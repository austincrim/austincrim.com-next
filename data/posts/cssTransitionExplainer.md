CSS transitions are easy to use and really add that final touch of polish to a UI. I love transitions and they make a site look more professional when used correctly. They were a little confusing at first for me, so I decided to whip up a quick CodePen showing how transitions are written.

Transitions are used to smoothly transition from one style to another. Here's an example using a button with hover and active states.

<p class="codepen" data-height="299" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="austincrim" data-slug-hash="rNxYMxa" style="height: 299px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CSS Transition Example">
