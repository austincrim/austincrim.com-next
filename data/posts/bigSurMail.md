After seeing the design of the newly announced macOS, Big Sur, I decided to try to remake the user interface of the macOS Mail app. I used TailwindCSS and Heroicons by Steve Schoeger to help me along.

Check it out [here](https://big-sur-mail.vercel.app) (not mobile friendly) and look at the source [here](https://github.com/austincrim/quick-design-projects/tree/master/big-sur-mail).

Let me know what you think!
