# About My Career
I landed my first dev job as a mainframe developer when I was twenty years old. I studied COBOL and JCL in school because I knew there was a shortage of mainframe expertise in my local area; this led to a great job at a young age. I was always interested in web development but I enjoyed my role immensely and, as I will talk about, I learned some great lessons in my first year of full time development. At the beginning of this year, I was placed on a temporary assignment working on an app that involved React, NodeJS, and cloud computing. Throughout this project, I realized that my experience of working with COBOL aided me in web development in some unexpected ways.
